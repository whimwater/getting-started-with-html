<P align="left">The World Wide Web was invented in the early 90's and is made up of HTML. HTML stands for
'Hyper Text Mark-up Language'. Programming works by connecting a computer and chosen browser with the Internet and Servers.
This is done thru HTTP (hyper text transfer protocols).<br><br>
HTML consists of text content, mark up, and references to other docs (e.g. images, videos, etc.)<br>
<br>
<strong>HTML Tags</strong><br>
  <em>*Please note: I've added the the text form of tags within single quotes intentially to show work.</em><br>
  <br>
  HTML mark-up is made up of tags. Tags have an opening tag '(&ltem&gt)' and a closing tag '(&lt/em&gt)'. 
'&ltb&gt'</em> is the <b>BOLD</b> tag.
'&ltem&gt' is the <em>ITALICS</em> tag.<br>
If you don't close a tag, <em>it will continue throughout the text until you close it.</em><br>
<b>
<br>
<strong>HTML Attributes</strong></b></strong><br>
An anchor '&lta&gt' is an HTML attribute and is used to make links.
<br>Using '&lta href="www.link.com"&gt display text &lt/a&gt', you create a link within text. Example: <a href= "www.google.com">Google</a>.<br>
<br>Another HTML attribute is used to add an image within a line of text. Using '&ltimg src="link to image"&gt' adds an image inline with text.<br>
Yay! Strawberries!

<br><b>White Space</b><br>I have been adding 'white space' in different ways throughout these notes. 
I can add white space by adding a line break tag '&ltbr&gt' or by adding a 
paragraph tag '&ltp&gt'. Both create white space, but are considered different types of elements. The <em>Paragraph tag</em> '&ltp&gt' 
is a block element and creates an imaginary box around content, the paragraph 'block' can be assigned a height and width.
"Inline elements" like line breaks '&ltbr&gt' stay within the line of text, as we saw with the image element.

<strong>HTML Documents</strong><br>
An HTML document is the entirety of the code for a given document. An HTML Document requires a 'doctype', 'head', and a 'body'.
The 'head'contains meta-data, css, etc., and the title of the document. The content is contained within the 'body'. All of the 
content in this document has been added to the "body" of my HTML code.
